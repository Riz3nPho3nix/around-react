# Project 10: React Around the U.S.!

We are now learning how to use React! It is so exciting! I especially enjoy the ability to use hooks for functional programming.

In this sprint we learned: 

* JSX syntax

* Create React App

* useState() and useEffect()

* Hooks!! (My personal favorite)

* React dev tools

I am super excited to learn more of what React can do!
